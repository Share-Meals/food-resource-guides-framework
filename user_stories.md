## Ada, Director of a Food Policy Center

Ada realizes that information about food resources in her city is highly fragmented and difficult to track down. She helped a friend last week find a food pantry but the information she found online was out of date. She walked by a church with a sign saying they have open pantry hours but when she tried to look up the information later on Google to send to her friend, nothing came up. She knows that if she is having trouble tracking down food assistance then her neighbors and others in her city who facing larger difficulties likely find the same task impossible.

Ada finds out about the Food Resource Guides Framework and reaches out. Although her center has limited IT personnel and support, they are able to get the software up and running. She a new project to support the ongoing maintenaince and outreach of the guides, using provided training manuals, videos, and other material. Before the end of the month, Ada is able to point residents, community based organizations, and governmental agencies to the guides to reliably find food assistance immediately.

## Brenda, Store Clerk

Brenda works a part time job at CVS. She's been having a difficult time finding enough employment but is grateful for what she has. She has had to use food pantries in the past at the height of the pandemic and she knows how much of a life saver that was. While she no longer has to use them, she wants to make sure other people don't feel ashamed to visit them and can have the right information at their fingertips so they can feel in control throughout the process.

Brenda logs on to her city's virtual volunteer opportunity portal and searches for any organizations working with food pantries that need help. She finds out about Ada's organization and thinks that is a good fit for her, since she would only have to volunteer remotely and has the flexibility to fit it around her work schedule. She signs up for a 2 week shift.

Brenda meets with the volunteer manager on Ada's team and learns a bit more about the project. For the next 14 days, she logs onto the Food Resource Guides data management portal and is given information about one food pantry in their directory at a time. She calls the pantry and politely asks to verify information such as operating hours, dietary accommodations, and access requirements. Many of the places Brenda calls have no changes to report, but she occasionally has to update a pantry's hours or notes. After her 2 weeks are done, she's happy knowing that other people will have an easier time accessing food assistance when they need it. Brenda continues to volunteer every now and again.

## Carl, College Student

Carl is attending the local community college and has a student job there. He earns enough to cover his bills: gas for his car, rent and utilities, and enough groceries to be alright. He's not saving away anything but he's only got 1 more year until he graduates and figures that is ok.

This week, however, is finals week. He needs to concentrate on maintaining his GPA and has asked to not to take any shifts at work. Carl stays up late into the evening studying and he knows that it's the correct decision, but is running pretty low on money. He's hungry, which doesn't make it easier to concentrate on his studies.

Carl searches the app store for something that might help; he's heard of discount programs where he could maybe find an affordable meal. He comes across the Share Meals app and downloads it; through the app's real time map integrated with data from the Food Resource Guides Framework, he's able to find a food pantry within a 5 minute walk of the school library, where he's been spending most of his nights. Carl saves the food pantry's information to his phone and sets a reminder to stop by there tomorrow. When he arrives, he's able to walk away with a box of dry and canned goods that will last him the rest of finals week.

## Dierdra, Elderly Retiree

Dierdra lives off her pension, which is usually enough so that she doesn't have to worry. However, this month, a colder than normal winter and a hole in her roof means she has higher bills and not enough money to cover essentials. Her cabinets are starting to run empty but she doesn't want to ask her family or friends for help.

One day at church, her priest mentions a new city initiative, The Food Resource Guides, which helps anyone, regardless of their situation, find food. She grabs a flyer on the way home, which has a phone number on it. Later that night, she calls up and is greeted by a menu of languages to choose from. She pushes the button for Spanish, provides her current address, hears 3 listings of food pantries that are the closest to her, and writes them down.

The last food pantry's name is in Spanish and it's based out of a church that she doesn't know. She figures that she can go there without being recognized and yet still find appropriate help because she won't have to try to ask for help in English. She starts going there once a week and builds a friendship with the volunteers serving there.

## Elisabet, City Council Member

Elisabet is dedicated to improving the quality of life in her city, especially among children. She has been fighting to increase funding for the summer school food program, which provides all public school children with packaged meals even when school is not in session. This year, she notices that there is a bump in activity in one of the neighborhoods, an increase that is disproportionate with surrounding and similar neighborhoods. She goes to the distribution site one day and asks people what brought them out.

Elisabet learns that the Food Resource Guides listed this school as a distribution site and a Facebook post was being shared among parents in the neighborhood. She sees that there are so many people lined up today that the site has to close early. She reaches out to Ada's team, eager to provide mutual support. Elisabet receives usage and access data from the Guides, showing where in the city people are most searching for food assistance. She's able to alert Ada's team about 2 more city run programs in some of the neediest neighborhoods; she's also able to use the data to advocate for better wrap around services for children.
